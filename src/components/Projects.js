So, I set out to build it myself. It gave me great joy to be able to build something for myself and my friends. It is a full stack app deployed on Netlify. The app allows the user to send e-cards via email to selected recipients.'

It was created to be submitted as my 1st project for my bootcamp which I had a great time working on."
