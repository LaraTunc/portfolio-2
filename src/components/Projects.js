				<Description>
					I created this app as my final project for the bootcamp. <br />
					The idea struck me as I was looking for birthday e-cards for my friend
					and was not able to find any free options. Given this, I set out to
					build it myself. <br />
					It gave me great joy to be able to build something for myself and my
					friends. <br />
					It is a full stack app deployed on Netlify. The app allows the user to
					send e-cards via email to selected recipients.
					<div>
						Technologies used: Create react app, React.js, Node.js, Express,
						Nodemailer, MongoDB
